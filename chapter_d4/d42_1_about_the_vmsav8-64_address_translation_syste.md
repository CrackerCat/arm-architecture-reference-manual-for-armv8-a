# D4.2.1 About the VMSAv8-64 address translation system

The Memory Management Unit (MMU) controls address translation, memory access permissions, and memory
attribute determination and checking, for memory accesses made by the PE.

The general model of MMU operation is that the MMU takes information about a required memory access,
including an input address (IA), and either:

* Returns an associated output address (OA), and the memory attributes for that address.
* Is unable to perform the translation for one of a number of reasons, and therefore causes an exception to be
   generated. This exception is called an MMU fault. An MMU fault is generated by a particular stage of
  translation, and can be described as either a stage 1 MMU fault or a stage 2 MMU fault.
