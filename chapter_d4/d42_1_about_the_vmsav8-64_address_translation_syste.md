# D4.2.1 About the VMSAv8-64 address translation system

The Memory Management Unit (MMU) controls address translation, memory access permissions, and memory
attribute determination and checking, for memory accesses made by the PE.

The general model of MMU operation is that the MMU takes information about a required memory access,
including an input address (IA), and either:

* Returns an associated output address (OA), and the memory attributes for that address.
* Is unable to perform the translation for one of a number of reasons, and therefore causes an exception to be
   generated. This exception is called an MMU fault. An MMU fault is generated by a particular stage of
  translation, and can be described as either a stage 1 MMU fault or a stage 2 MMU fault.

The process of mapping an IA to an OA is an address translation, or more precisely a single stage of address
translation.

The architecture defines a number of translation regimes, where a translation regime comprises either:

* A single stage of address translation.
This maps an input virtual address (VA) to an output physical address (PA).
* 
Two, sequential, stages of address translation, where:
  - Stage 1 maps an input VA to an output intermediate physical address (IPA).
  - Stage 2 maps an input IPA to an output PA.

The translation granule specifies the granularity of the mapping from IA to OA. That is, it defines both:

* The page size for a stage of address translation, where a page is the smallest block of memory for which an
IA to OA mapping can be specified.
The size of a complete translation table for that stage of address translation.
