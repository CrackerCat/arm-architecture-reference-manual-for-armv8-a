# D4.1 VMSA 简介

此小节描述了 AArch64 运行态下的 PE 中的虚拟内存系统架构，
即VMSAv8-64 (Virtual Memory System Architecture on AArch64)。

VMSA 实现了内存管理单元，即MMU。MMU在系统中为PE的内存操作提供地址转换，访问权限控制
以及内存属性的设定和校验功能。

> The process of address translation maps the virtual addresses (VAs) used by 
 > PE onto the physical addresses (PAs) of the physical memory system. 
> These translations are defined independently for different Exception levels
