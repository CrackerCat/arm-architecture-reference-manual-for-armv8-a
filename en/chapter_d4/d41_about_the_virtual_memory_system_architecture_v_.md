># D4.1 About the Virtual Memory System Architecture (VMSA)

[`Chinese`](../../zh/chapter_d4/d41_about_the_virtual_memory_system_architecture_v_.html)

> This chapter describes the Virtual Memory System Architecture (VMSA) 
 > that applies to a PE executing in AArch64 state.
> This is VMSAv8-64, as defined in [ARMv8 VMSA naming on page D4-1643](todo.md).

> A VMSA provides a Memory Management Unit (MMU), 
 > that controls address translation, access permissions,
 > and memory attribute determination and checking, 
 > for memory accesses made by the PE.

> The process of address translation maps the virtual addresses (VAs) used by 
 > PE onto the physical addresses (PAs) of the physical memory system. 
> These translations are defined independently for different Exception levels
 > and Security states, and Figure D4-1 shows.

> VMSAv8-64 supports tagging of VAs,
 >as described in [Address tagging in AArch64 state](todo.md).
> As that section describes,
 > this address tagging has no effect on the address translation process.

> The remainder of this chapter gives a full description of VMSAv8-64
 > for an implementation that includes all of the Exception levels.
> [The implemented Exception levels and the resulting translation stages and regimes on
 >page D4-1679](todo.md) describes the differences in the VMSA
 > if some Exception levels are not implemented.
